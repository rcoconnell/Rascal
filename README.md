# Rascal
Rapid sampler for large covariance matrices

This code is based on the method described in O'Connell et al. ([arxiv:1510.01740](https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.01740)). 
If you use this code in a project, please cite that paper.
*Rascal* uses importance sampling to quickly estimate the covariance matrices for 2-point correlation functions.
The survey geometry and 2-point correlation function are each described in separate libraries,
to facilitate applications to a wide variety of situations.
Additional sample libraries and a 1.0 release are coming soon!
